# Box objects

A box is a rectangle with a specified width and height.  The default
width and height are the values of the "`boxwid`" and "`boxht`" variables.

If a "`radius`" is specified, then the corners of the box are rounded using
arcs of the given radius.  The default radius for each new box is the value
of the "`boxrad`" variable which is initially 0.0.
