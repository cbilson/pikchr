# position

A *position* is a point on the SVG canvas.  A *[place](./place.md)* is
a specific position associated with an object.  Every *place* is a *position*,
but not every *position* is a *place*.  This page is about *position*.

## Absolute verus Place-relative Positions

One form of a position is an (X,Y) coordinate pair.  This works, but
its use is discouraged.  It is better to use positions that are 
either a *[place](./place.md)* or is derived from one or more places.

## The "**(** *position* **,** *position* **)**" Form

A place of the form "(pos1,pos2)" where pos1 and pos2 are other positions
means use the X coordinate from pos1 and the Y coordinate from pos2.

~~~ pikchr
leftmargin = 1cm;
P1: dot; text "P1" with .s at 2mm above P1
P2: dot at P1+(2cm,-2cm); text "P2" with .s at 2mm above P2
dot at (P1,P2); text "(P1,P2)" with .s at 2mm above last dot
dot at (P2,P1); text "(P2,P1)" with .s at 2mm above last dot
~~~

## "*fraction* **of the way between**" Forms

All of these syntactic forms of position are the same:

  *  *fraction* **of the way between** *position* **and** *position*
  *  *fraction* **way between** *position* **and** *position*
  *  *fraction* **between** *position* **and** *position*
  *  *fraction* **<** *position* **,** *position* **>**

The last form is the most cryptic, but it is also the most compact
and hence ends up being the most often used.

In all cases *fraction* is an expression that evalutes to between 0.0
and 1.0.  The resulting position is that fraction along a line that
connects the first *position* to the second *position*.

The *fraction* can be less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, in which case
the point is on the extended line that connections the two positions.

~~~ pikchr
P1: dot; text "P1" with .s at 2mm above P1
P2: dot at P1+(4cm,1.5cm); text "P2" with .s at 2mm above P2
line thin color gray dotted from -.5<P1,P2> to 1.5<P1,P2>
dot at 3/4<P1,P2>; text "3/4<P1,P2>" at (last dot,P1)
   arrow thin color gray from last text.n to 1mm south of last dot
dot at -0.25 of the way between P1 and P2
   text "-0.25 of the way between P1 and P2" at (last dot,P2)
   arrow thin color gray from last text.s to 1mm north of last dot

## "*position* *which-way-from* *position*" Forms

It is very common to specify a position as an offset from some other
position using this format.  Some examples:

  *  1cm below Obstacle.s
  *  0.5*linewid left of C0.w
  *  dist(C2,C3) heading 30 from C2
