# How To Compile Pikchr

## Overview

  *  Primary source file: "`pikchr.y`"
  *  Process "`pikchr.y`" using Lemon (sources provided in tree)
     to create "`pikchr.c`"
  *  Compile "`pikchr.c`" into an object file, or add the
     "`-DPIKCHR_SHELL`" command-line option to generate a stand-alone
     executable.

## Details:

The source code for Pikchr is in the file named "`pikchr.y`".  As
the ".y" suffix implies, this file is grammar specification intended
as input to the yacc-like LALR(1) parser generator program
"[Lemon][lemon]".  Even though "pikchr.y" is technically a Lemon
grammar file, it consists of mostly C-code and only 6% grammar.

Running the command:

~~~~
   lemon pikchr.y
~~~~

Generates "`pikchr.c`" as an output file.  (Lemon generates a couple
of other output files that can be ignored for this project.)  The
"pikchr.c" file is pure C code ready to be compiled into the final
application.  It can be compiled by itself with the
"-DPIKCHR_SHELL" command-line option to generate a standalone program
that reads Pikchr scripts and emits HTML with embedded SVG.  Or
it can be integrated into a larger application which invokes the
"`pikchr()`" C-API to do conversions from Pikchr to SVG.

As the Lemon tool is not widely deployed, its sources for 
Lemon are included in the Pikchr source tree for convenience.
Compile the "`lemon.c`" source program into an executable using
any ordinary C-compiler.

When the lemon executable runs, it looks for the "`lempar.c`" template
in the working directory.  The "`lempar.c`" template is also included
in the Pikchr source repository for convenience.

## Preprocessed Sources Available For Download.

If you don't want to go to the trouble of compiling Lemon and then
running the "`pikchr.y`" source file through Lemon to generate
the "`pikchr.c`" C-code, you can download a pre-built copy
of "`pikchr.c`" directly from the
[Fossil source repository][piksrc].
