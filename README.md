Pikchr (pronounced like "picture") is a [PIC][1]-like markup
language for diagrams in technical documentation.  Pikchr is
designed to be embedded in [fenced code blocks][2] of
Markdown (or in similar mechanisms in other markup languages)
to provide a convenient means of showing diagrams.

[2]: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#fenced-code-blocks

For example, the diagram:

~~~~ pikchr
arrow; box "Hello, World!"; arrow
~~~~

Is generated using the following markup:

~~~~~~
   ~~~~ pikchr
   arrow; box "Hello, World!"; arrow
   ~~~~
~~~~~~

## A Work In Progress

As of this writing (2020-09-09), Pikchr is a work-in-progress.
More documentation is forthcoming.  We want to use Pikchr to write
the Pikchr documentation, but it order to do that, we first have
to deploy Pikchr into a working system ([Fossil][3]) and that means
the initial deployment has to be undocumented.  Volunteers are
welcomed, of course.

## Derivation From PIC

The inspiration for Pikchr is the venerable PIC language from
Bell Labs (circa late 1970s, early 1980s).  Pikchr is *mostly*
compatible with PIC, though Pikchr has many extensions, and
it omits some legacy-PIC features (such as the "sh" command)
that would be a security issue in modern software.  Most of the
example PIC scripts contained in the [PIC User Manual][4] work
fine with Pikchr, perhaps with a few minor tweaks.  For example:

~~~~ pikchr
        margin = 5mm; leftmargin = 2cm

        circle "DISK"
        arrow "character" "defns" right 150%
CPU:    box "CPU" "(16-bit mini)"
        /*{*/ arrow <- from top of CPU up "input " rjust /*}*/
        arrow right from CPU.e
CRT:    "   CRT" ljust wid 1px
        line from CRT - 0,0.075 up 0.15 \
                then right 0.5 \
                then right 0.5 up 0.25 \
                then down 0.5+0.15 \
                then left 0.5 up 0.25 \
                then left 0.5
Paper:  CRT + 1.05,0.75
        arrow <- from Paper down 1.5
        " ...  paper" ljust at end of last arrow + 0, 0.25
        circle rad 0.05 at Paper + (-0.055, -0.25)
        circle rad 0.05 at Paper + (0.055, -0.25)
        "   rollers" ljust at Paper + (0.1, -0.25)

PIC and Pikchr are sufficiently similar that you can get started using
Pikchr by reading the PIC user manual.

See the [raw Markdown source text for this page][5] to see more
examples.
